Welcome to my page!  I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate and PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Liverpool, UK.

## Research Interests

My research interest is in the mathematical modelling of real-world problems. Currently, I am working on developing mathematical frameworks for stochastic and deterministic real-world processes such as ecological and eco-evolutionary systems on networks, epidemics, and vaccination—often supported by real and/or synthetic data. My skills include mathematical modelling, qualitative analysis of differential equations-based models, generating synthetic data for Markovian processes, and data analysis with a particular focus on estimating key parameters from it. If you wish to read about my past research activities, please see [Past Research Activities](past_research_activities.md) .

## Volunteer Activities
I grew up in an underdeveloped and educationally disadvantaged area. During my summer vacations from 2013 to 2020, I dedicated my time to teaching deserving students of all levels. Inspired by this passion for education, together with very passionate group of  friends, we establish the [The Maths Volunteers Foundation](https://sites.google.com/view/mathsvolunteers/home).
