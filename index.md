**Welcome to my page!**  
I am a Research Associate and PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Liverpool, UK.

## Research Interests

My research interest lies in mathematical modelling of real-world problems. Currently, I am developing mathematical frameworks for stochastic and deterministic processes, such as ecological and eco-evolutionary systems on networks, epidemics, and vaccination—often supported by real and/or synthetic data. My skills include
mathematical modelling,
qualitative analysis of differential equations-based models,
generating synthetic data for Markovian processes, and
data analysis with a focus on estimating key parameters.
For my past research activities, please see [Past Research Activities](past_research_activities.md).

## Volunteer Activities

I grew up in an underdeveloped and educationally disadvantaged area. From 2013 to 2020, I dedicated my summer vacations to teaching deserving students of all levels. Inspired by this passion for education and a passionate group of friends, we established [The Maths Volunteers Foundation](https://sites.google.com/view/mathsvolunteers/home).
